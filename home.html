          </h5>
          <h6>
            Here's what I'm reading:
          </h6>
          <table class="bookshelf-table">
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="images/tdd.jpeg" width="100px"/> <br/>
                I've started this and I'm excited to learn more about how the 3 steps of TDD lead to great software.
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="images/continuous_delivery.jpeg" width="100px"/> <br/>
                Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery have been done in different ways at the companies I've
                worked. I look forward to reading
                through this one to see if there are best practices that can be followed for CD, no matter which
                technologies or tools are being used.
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="images/essential_scrum.jpeg" width="100px"/> <br/>
                I started this one back when I was working as ScrumMaster for one of the teams I was on. It was helpful
                as a primer on the different Scrum ceremonies and the different roles there are on a Scrum team. I
                definitely want to finish this one so I can help identify issues with Scrum teams I'm a part of in the
                future and help correct them.
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="images/clean_code.jpeg" width="100px"/> <br/>
                I/ve really enjoyed working through this one; I haven't finished it but it has a lot of good reference
                points for how clean code should look in general. Developers have varying opinions about clean code,
                but I think it's cool how this book attempts to set a baseline.
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="images/design_patterns.jpeg" width="100px"/> <br/>
                This one has been fun to step through - I especially enjoy the quirky examples that accompany each
                pattern, and the different types of sections in the book (like Q&A's, interviews, diagrams) that
                help keep the content fresh and exciting. Maybe after I finish this I'll check out the Gang of Four
                book on Design Patterns.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="images/coders_at_work.jpeg" width="100px"/> <br/>
                I haven't started this yet but it sounded like it would be a cool window into different types of
                software professions.
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="images/pro_git.jpeg" width="100px"/> <br/>
                This book has been helpful as I've gotten started learning Git, having come from an SVN background.
                I've preferred to use Git on the command line rather than using a tool like SourceTree, so having
                a reference like this is helpful.
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="images/five_dysfunctions.jpeg" width="100px"/> <br/>
                I thought this was an interesting take on the common issues affecting teams both large and small, executive
                and non-executive - even though the account was fictional, the constructs surrounding team
                dysfunctions were very real and I could apply them mentally to teams I have been on in the past.
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="images/intelligent_investor.jpeg" width="100px"/> <br/>
                I didn't have much of a formal financial education, so investing and money management has been a
                new concept for me. I've heard a lot about Benjamin Graham and his ideas about value investing, and
                how his ideas have stood the test of time. I intend to finish this one as soon as possible.
